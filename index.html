            Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. 
            I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. 
            You did come back different.

            Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.

            We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the  point where you can work for your whole life.
             Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. 
             Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as Honey!
